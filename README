visbinary.py - Visualize a binary as colors by byte type.
==============================================================================
The colors are chosen by the type of the byte read:
- black for 0x00,
- green for 'low' bytes (0x01 to 0x1f)
- blue for ASCII bytes (0x20 to 0x7e)
- red for 'high' bytes (0x7f to 0xfe)
- white for 0xff

You can visualize any file you want (granted you have access to it),
though currently only one file at a time.

Requirements
===============================================================================
* A color-compatible terminal (emulator)
* Python 3

Usage
===============================================================================
visbinary.py [-h] [-p] [-c COLOUMNS] [-o] filename

positional arguments:
  filename              path to the file you want to visualize

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p, --print           print out the bytes as hex
  -c COLUMNS, --coloumns COLUMNS
                        number of bytes (columns) per row (default 32)
  -o, --offset          print out the file offset (in hex) at the beginning of
                        each line
